# Uncertainty-Aware Unsupervised Image Deblurring with Deep Residual Prior
This is the official `Python` implementation of the [CVPR 2023](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/)  paper **Uncertainty-Aware Unsupervised Image Deblurring with Deep Residual Prior**
The repository contains reproducible `PyTorch` source code for computing the deblurred image and residual given a single kernel and blurry image.

Here are the [Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Tang_Uncertainty-Aware_Unsupervised_Image_Deblurring_With_Deep_Residual_Prior_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf) and [Supplementary material](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/supplemental/Tang_Uncertainty-Aware_Unsupervised_Image_CVPR_2023_supplemental.pdf).

If the inputs contain only blurry images, you will need to run some outsourcing kernel estimation algorithm to obtain the kernel. The datasets folder include some estimated kernel and corresponding blurry images for test.

Before runing `UDeblur_demo.py`, the first thing you have to do is to pre-process the (estimated) kernel with Fourier transformation and save it as a `.mat` file. We provide an example for this procdure, see `Ker.m`; where the FFT of blur kernel is done via the function `extendHforConv.m`.
